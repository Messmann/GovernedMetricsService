#GMS Prerequisites


Minimum Requirements:

- The Governed Metrics Service requires Qlik Sense Server.
- The Governed Metrics Service has been tested with Qlik Sense 3.x.x
- A data source that can be accessed via Data Connection in Qlik Sense (Excel, ODBC etc.)
- The Governed Metrics Service requires a licensed Qlik Sense server.
- Please do not install for use with Qlik Sense desktop.  The Governed Metrics Service will not work.

Before installing the Governed Metrics Service, __we highly recommend__ going through the Qlik Sense server QMC configuration instructions in the documentation.  Application, custom property, and task names will be requested during the install and it's easier on your memory if you have created them in advance.
